VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is *specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media*.

## Main differences from the original implementation.

* **NO hardcoded rules**, everything is configurable in the lexicon files, allowing the addition of new languages without changing the code.
* **Blazingly fast!** In my machine evaluates 170.000 sentences per second vs 26.000 using the original python implementation.
* Emojis have valence values.
* Possibility to add exceptions to the rules.
* Possibility to use regular expressions in the rules.
* Possibility to normalize the input string: diacritics removal *(accents removal)*, string replacement.

## Available Languages

* English
* Portuguese
* German - Lexicon adapted from [GerVADER](https://github.com/KarstenAMF/GerVADER).

## Usage

1. Download the desired lexicon file(s).

   - [English](https://github.com/knuppe/vader/raw/main/lexicons/en/en.zip)
   - [Portuguese](https://github.com/knuppe/vader/raw/main/lexicons/pt/pt.zip)
   - [German](https://github.com/knuppe/vader/raw/main/lexicons/de/de.zip)

2. Download the module.  
   `go get -u github.com/knuppe/vader@latest`

3. Have fun ;)
   
Here is a minimal Go program that uses this package in order
to analyze a sentence.

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/knuppe/vader"
)

func main(){
	// you need to download de lexicon zip files.
	v, err := vader.NewVader("lexicons/en/en.zip")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	score := v.PolarityScores("VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!")

	fmt.Printf(
		"neg: %.3f, neu: %.3f, pos: %.3f, compound: %.3f (%s)",
		score.Negative,
		score.Neutral,
		score.Positive,
		score.Compound,
		score.Sentiment(),
	)
	// neg: 0.000, neu: 0.248, pos: 0.752, compound: 0.844 (positive)
}
```
